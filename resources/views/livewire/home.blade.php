                <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">In the FPS+ Rust Map, the terrain is flat and smooth, with unnecessary prefabs removed and fewer rock formations. This improvement is designed to enhance server performance and player FPS. For additional details, please refer to the map description.</p>
                <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">As visible in the image, there is no grass (tundra biome). We've utilized a special biome type to paint the terrain, resulting in shorter grass. This adjustment is aimed at enhancing player FPS in-game.</p>
                <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">We have removed large mountains and cliffs, eliminating extensive formations. This absence of substantial rock formations contributes to a reduced map size. Typically, a Rust map occupies 40MB - 50MB, but without large rock formations, the number of prefabs decreases, significantly lowering the file size to approximately 12MB - 20MB</p>
                <p class="text-gray-700">Don't worry about the cloth spawns. Only the Arid and Arctic biomes don't have cloth spawns, but the other two biomes do have cloth, also known as hemp, spawning. Berries, mushrooms, etc., will also spawn in their respective forest topologies.</p>

This setup offers additional advantages such as teleportation and full support for the Monument addons plugin. Please consult the map description for all the details.</p>
                <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">We maintain the Outpost as the default entity, ensuring that everything within the Outpost remains unchanged. This approach facilitates the functionality of plugins such as NTeleportation and MonumentsFinder, allowing them to accurately locate monuments for configuring specific teleport points or entities.</p>
                <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">Our maps are primarily designed with a focus on PvP, resulting in smaller PvP-grade maps typically sized at 3450, 3750, 4000, 4250, and 6000 (roaming). I personally prefer creating maps similar to 'Vital Rust' and 'WarBandits'</p>

                <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">We use a special biome pattern for our paid maps, aiming to include all four biome types: Arctic, Desert (Arid), Temperature (Long grass), and Tundra (Short grass). Free maps, on the other hand, do not come with a custom biome pattern due to the time it takes to create them. Free maps only feature the merged Outpost with Bandit Camp and more features. You can checkout our free maps collection <a href="{{ route('free') }}" class="underline text-rust font-bold">here</a></p>
                <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">We use all four biome designs to ensure that all biome-specific monuments spawn appropriately, such as the Arctic base in the snow biome, military base in the desert biome, etc. Using all four biomes ensures that we don't miss out on those monuments.</p>
                <p class="text-gray-700">We try our best to divided the map into three biomes, primarily Arctic, Desert, and Temperature. The Temperature biome is mixed with Tundra.</p>
